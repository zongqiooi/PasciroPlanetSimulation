# PasciroPlanetSimulation
PaSciRo Planet Simulation is a simulation that is used to observe the behaviors of the three different types of monsters. All the monsters will move randomly and collide with each other in the plot. After the simulation, data will be generated for investigating the behaviors of the three different types of monsters.
